# Grocery Helper
How many times have you gone grocery shopping and stocked up only to throw out unconsumed expired products by the next trip?

We know that heart break. So, we built Grocery Helper!


Grocery Helper is an iPhone app which helps you track your purchases so, you can minimize food waste! 


Grocery Helper will:
- remind you when you have an item at home so, you don't buy it again. 
- tell you when an item is about to expire so, you can consume or re-stock.
- suggest items to add to your next shopping trip based on your previous shopping experiences!
