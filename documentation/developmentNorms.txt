Development Norms: 

HTML: We are using HTML to create a web app. We are hosting the web app on Github.The web app is under the repository grocery-helper.github.io. 

One HTML branch is our master branch the master branch which has our landing page. 

The second HTML branch is our classes branch which is in HTML with embedded php. 


The second is classes which documents the classes for our project. 


Php: We used RemoteMySQL to host our database on the web so that we can use phpMyAdmin to manage our database.

TODO: phpMyAdmin allows us to export a SQL file that can recreate our database; we will include this in our documentation later once our database is fully updated.

We also have a phpScripts branch in our original repository grocery-helper/grocery-helper, that contains the scripts connecting our database to php through phpAdmin, serving as an API. 


SQL: We are using a MySQL database, once it is fully up to date we plan on moving it to our repository and updating this documentation. The relationships and entities in the database are demonstrated in the ER diagram in this folder.
